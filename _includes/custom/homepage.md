# Introduction

R.NET enables the .NET Framework to interoperate with the R statistical language _in the same process_. R.NET requires the .NET Framework 4 and the native R shared libraries installed with the R environment. You can use R.NET from any language targetting .NET (it has been used at least from C#, F#, Vb.NET, IronPython). A couple of related works must be mentioned before you dive into this documentation. For F#, you probably should consider F# R Provider. One motivation for releasing 1.5.13 is for the RProvider to more easily manage dependency on R.NET.
