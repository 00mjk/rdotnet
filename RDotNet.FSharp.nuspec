    <title>R.NET F# Utility</title>
    <version>0.2</version>
    <releaseNotes>
      (1) Fix for https://github.com/jmp75/rdotnet/issues/14: statements such as "cat('string with #hashtags')" was not parsed anymore in version 1.6 - now fixed.
      (2) Known limitation: statements with # characters inside R characters such as "cat ('This is \n a multiline statement with #hashtag \n in it')" is not executed properly.
      (3) Note that AutoPrint is now true by default, to match the default R behavior. You may want to turn this to False to increase the calculation performances on large data sets.
